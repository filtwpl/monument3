# monument3
My final project for my MAAD 14920 class at the University of Chicago, made with Twine.

This is like Monument Valley 2 but turned "horror-y". Not sure how much this counts as horror but it is definitely different!
I've put in themes of untrustworthy software, mazes/labyrinths, and some other stuff we've learned this quarter. 

Improvements to be made:
Figure out how to make videos' positioning the same as images. Twine was really fighting me with it. :(
Better writing lol.
