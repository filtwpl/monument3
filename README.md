# monument3
My final project for my MAAD 14920 class at the University of Chicago, made with Twine.

Link to game here: https://jacqsm.itch.io/monument-valley-3, because github could not handle all my files ðŸ˜”

This is like Monument Valley 2 but turned "horror-y". Not sure how much this counts as horror but it is definitely different!
I've put in themes of untrustworthy software, mazes/labyrinths, and some other stuff we've learned this quarter. 

More notes in the itch.io link :)
